# Password Sorcerer

Password Sorcerer is a password generator application. The application uses CustomTkInter as the GUI library and Pyperclip to allow users to copy generated passwords to their clipboard.

## Purpose
Password Sorcerer began as an application used to test out the Python knowledge I learned from tutorials. 

## Current Project State
At the moment, this project is complete and more featuresa aren't planned in the immediate future. Eventually, more features may be added, such as saved password templates & minimum amounts of each character type. At the moment I'm simply testing out different languages for future projects.
